It uses rsync over ssh, with settings that attempt to preserve Mac OS X file attributes even if the server is not a Mac or does not use an HFS+ file system.\r\n\r\n----\r\n*Author*:       Michael Hucka (http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~mhucka)\r\n\r\n*Copyright*:    Copyright (C) 2008-2014 by the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, USA.\r\n\r\n*License*:      This code is licensed under the LGPL version 2.1.  Please see the Please see the file [../COPYING.txt](https://raw.github.com/mhucka/rsmirror/master/COPYING.txt) for details.\r\n\r\n*Project page*: http://mhucka.github.io/rsmirror\r\n\r\n*Repository*:   https://github.com/mhucka/rsmirror\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\n1. This requires `rsync` 3.0.5 or higher on both the client and backup server.\r\n\r\n2. This requires the `fileflags` and `crtimes` patches for `rsync` to be applied on Mac OS X systems.  For more information, see the `rsync` patch directory (which, for version 3.0.5, is http://rsync.samba.org/ftp/rsync/src/rsync-patches-3.0.5.tar.gz).  As of 2011-01-19, the version of `rsync` supplied by MacPorts is 3.0.7 and includes the necessary patches.\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n----------\r\n\r\nSometimes you want to mirror one or more directories to a remote machine, for example to keep off-site file backups for emergencies, or for remote access (e.g., if you regularly work from two sites), or simply to use as an alternative to a cloud-based backup system.  The tried and true secure scheme is to use `rsync` over ssh between Unix/Linux-based systems.  However, when copying files from Mac OS X systems to non-Mac systems, one has to provide a number of arguments to `rsync` to preserve as many of the Mac OS X file attributes as possible (and the copy of `rsync` on the server may need to be patched to support the arguments).  This script encapsulates these arguments, plus adds a few additional useful features for situations where you are regularly mirroring a directory to a remote machine (such as making it delete files from the remote copy if they are no longer present in the source directory being mirrored).\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe installation process is simple.\r\n\r\n**1.** Copy `rsmirror.sh` to a directory of your choosing, and make sure it is executable.\r\n\r\n**2.** Copy `sample.config` to a location of your choosing, renaming it to something suitable (perhaps named after the directory you are going to mirror).  If you want to create multiple mirroring configurations, copy `sample.config` as many times as you need and give each copy a different name.\r\n\r\n**3.** Edit the configuration file(s).  Set the values for the different variables inside.  The comments explain the purposes of the variables.\r\n\r\n**4.** Test your configurations, first by invoking `rsmirror.sh -n -c CONFIG` (where the `-n` flag tells rsmirror.sh to echo what it will do without actually doing it, and `CONFIG` is the path to a configuration file from steps 2-3), and then by invoking `rsmirror.sh -c CONFIG` and checking that it appears to have done what you expected.\r\n\r\nOnce that is done, you can invoke `rsmirror.sh -c CONFIG` whenever you want to mirror the directory.  You may find it convenient to set up a cron job to perform the task on a nightly basis.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n`rsmirror.sh` takes three arguments, one required and two optional:\r\n\r\n* `-c CONFIG` is a required argument; `CONFIG` must be the pathname of a configuration file.\r\n\r\n* `-n` means do a \"dry run\": explain what would be done without actually doing it.\r\n\r\n* `-q` means be quiet: don't print informative messages.  (However, if logging is configured, then `rsmirror.sh` will still write the log file.)\r\n\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\nI welcome improvements of all kinds, to the code and to the documentation.\r\nPlease feel free to contact me or do the following:\r\n\r\n1.
