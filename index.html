<p>A shell script for mirroring a Mac OS X directory to a remote computer.  It uses rsync over ssh, with settings that attempt to preserve Mac OS X file attributes even if the server is not a Mac or does not use an HFS+ file system.</p>

<h2>
<a name="requirements" class="anchor" href="#requirements"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Requirements</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>This requires <code>rsync</code> 3.0.5 or higher on both the client and backup server.</p></li>
<li><p>This requires the <code>fileflags</code> and <code>crtimes</code> patches for <code>rsync</code> to be applied on Mac OS X systems.  For more information, see the <code>rsync</code> patch directory (which, for version 3.0.5, is <a href="http://rsync.samba.org/ftp/rsync/src/rsync-patches-3.0.5.tar.gz">http://rsync.samba.org/ftp/rsync/src/rsync-patches-3.0.5.tar.gz</a>).  As of 2011-01-19, the version of <code>rsync</code> supplied by MacPorts is 3.0.7 and includes the necessary patches.</p></li>
</ol><h2>
<a name="background" class="anchor" href="#background"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h2>

<p>Sometimes you want to mirror one or more directories to a remote machine, for example to keep off-site file backups for emergencies, or for remote access (e.g., if you regularly work from two sites), or simply to use as an alternative to a cloud-based backup system.  The tried and true secure scheme is to use <code>rsync</code> over ssh between Unix/Linux-based systems.  However, when copying files from Mac OS X systems to non-Mac systems, one has to provide a number of arguments to <code>rsync</code> to preserve as many of the Mac OS X file attributes as possible (and the copy of <code>rsync</code> on the server may need to be patched to support the arguments).  This script encapsulates these arguments, plus adds a few additional useful features for situations where you are regularly mirroring a directory to a remote machine (such as making it delete files from the remote copy if they are no longer present in the source directory being mirrored).</p>

<h2>
<a name="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<p>The installation is simple.</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Copy <code>rsmirror.sh</code> to a directory of your choosing, and make sure it is executable.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Copy <code>sample.config</code> to a location of your choosing, renaming it to something suitable (perhaps named after the directory you are going to mirror).  If you want to create multiple mirroring configurations, copy <code>sample.config</code> as many times as you need and give each copy a different name.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Edit the configuration file(s).  Set the values for the different variables inside.  The comments explain the purposes of the variables.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Test your configurations, first by invoking <code>rsmirror.sh -n -c CONFIG</code> (where the <code>-n</code> flag tells rsmirror.sh to echo what it will do without actually doing it, and <code>CONFIG</code> is the path to a configuration file from steps 2-3), and then by invoking <code>rsmirror.sh -c CONFIG</code> and checking that it appears to have done what you expected.</p>

<p>Once that is done, you can invoke <code>rsmirror.sh -c CONFIG</code> whenever you want to mirror the directory.  You may find it convenient to set up a cron job to perform the task on a nightly basis.</p>

<h2>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p><code>rsmirror.sh</code> takes three arguments, one required and two optional:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>-c CONFIG</code> is a required argument; <code>CONFIG</code> must be the pathname of a configuration file.</p></li>
<li><p><code>-n</code> means do a "dry run": explain what would be done without actually doing it.</p></li>
<li><p><code>-q</code> means be quiet: don't print informative messages.  (However, if logging is configured, then <code>rsmirror.sh</code> will still write the log file.)</p></li>
